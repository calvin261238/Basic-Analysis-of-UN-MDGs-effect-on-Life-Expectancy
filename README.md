# Basic-Analysis-of-UN-MDGs-effect-on-Life-Expectancy

Background:
MDG, Millennium Development Goals, was signed and brought into effect by United Nation in Sep 2000, and officially ended its mission in 2015.

The Eight Millennium Development Goals are:
  to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger;
  to achieve universal primary education;
  to promote gender equality and empower women;
  to reduce child mortality;
  to improve maternal health;
  to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases;
  to ensure environmental sustainability; and
  to develop a global partnership for development.
  
Analysis point and what i wanted to find out:
After MDGs successfully complete its mission, i expect that the life expectancy would be improve greatly from all the countries in the world. This analysis is meant to determine whether MDG truley helped extending the average life of people.

Outcome:
During 1980~2000, some of the countries, particularly countries located in Africa, have experienced negative growth of life expectancy. Zimbabwe ranked as the worst, which its population's life expectancy decreased 13.19.

However, things started to change after 2000. My assumption is that MDG played some role to the overall improvement of life expectancy. Here are my findings:
Only Syrian Arab Republic experienced negative growth of life expectancy, primarily due to war. The other countries have improved, especially Rwanda, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.

In conclusion, it is clear that MDGs had a great impact on life expectancy of most countries.
